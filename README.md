# Green-Panther

It is a website built by me and my friends to create awareness among people to save fossil fuels (Petrol/Diesel). The idea behind is to make a game like a website which encourage people to use a vehicle which requires less fuel like buses, taxies or they can go to the office using bicycles or by walk even.

We would calculate the distance travelled by the user and the vehicle used and will award points accordingly. for example, if someone used a personal car, he/she would get fewer points whereas someone who travelled by bus will get more.

The points collected will be used for planting trees.

### Features
* Authorization and authentication 
* Points table to see the standings.
* User profile to get information about the observer
* Used geolocation API to calculate distance

## Tech stack
* Frontend:- HTML,CSS and React.js
*Backend:-Node.js and React.js
*Database:-MongoDb
